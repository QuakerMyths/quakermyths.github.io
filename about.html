title: About Us
---

<p>This site was started by a couple of Liberal Friends in the Eastern US who noticed a need for an FAQ of sorts.  The plan started as "let's have business cards we can hand out that say things like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Quakers aren't Amish</li>
	<li>We use computers</li>
	<li>We don't dress funny&hellip;usually"</li>
</ul>
<p>There are too many to fit on one business card though, so here we have a much larger site, and we figure we can put a few basics with a "learn more at QuakerMythBusters.org" note at the bottom.</p>
<p>The site has been opened up to edits and improvements on GitHub.</p>

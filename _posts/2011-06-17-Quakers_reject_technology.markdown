**FALSE** Quakers have generally accepted technological advances. Many consider scientific progress to be an example of Revelation in action. There are many online communities for Quakers, including the social networking site [QuakerQuaker](http://quakerquaker.org) and even a [Quaker IRC channel (chatroom)](http://irc.quaker.eu.org) run by a bunch of Free Software developers.

Back when the printing press was the height of technology, Quakers embraced it as a means to spread the message, printing many tracts, pamphlets, and treatises. Today, the Internet is the way to get the message out.

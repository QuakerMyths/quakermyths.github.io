**FALSE** This is an example of the [Quakers are Puritans](http://quakermythbusters.org/Quakers_are_Puritans.html) myth.

The Plymouth Colony started in 1620. Quakerism did not begin until the 1650s.  When Quakers came to the New World, it was mostly to Pennsylvania, since William Penn set it up as one of the two colonies with religious freedom (Rhode Island being the other one).

**FALSE** Quakers take equality and integrity very seriously. The introduction of price tags and charging everyone the same price (no discounts just because you're nobility or because you haggle well) made some waves. Quaker business owners weren't "lying" about the value of a good by marking it up or playing favourites (which would be unequal). These business practices meant people learned to trust Quaker-run businesses as places they could get a fair deal.  

Wanting to take advantage of this association with "trustworthy business" the founders of the Quaker Oats company used the name "Quaker" as a marketing strategy, but they were not themselves Quakers.

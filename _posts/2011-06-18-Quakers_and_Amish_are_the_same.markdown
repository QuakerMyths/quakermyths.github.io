**FALSE** The Amish are a offshoot of the Mennonites, an Anabaptist sect.  Anabaptists believe in baptism in adulthood, when the person is old enough to make that choice. Quakers don't believe in water baptism at all, since it is nothing more than an outward form, not the more-important baptism of the spirit.

This misconception comes from the same place as [Quakers dress like the Quaker Oats man](/Quakers_dress_like_the_Quaker_Oats_man.html). The old plain dress that used to be common among Quakers is similar to that worn by the Amish, though members of each sect could likely tell which group's rules one was following.
